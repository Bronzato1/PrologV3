Design patterns have evolved from years of experience in resolving frequently encountered problems when writing object-oriented software. These patterns are templates that provide developers with a blueprint on how to create flexible, easily maintainable applications.

Like a building, design patterns can differ in style and form but not in purpose. Their purpose remains the same; to provide a solid structural framework for an application.
