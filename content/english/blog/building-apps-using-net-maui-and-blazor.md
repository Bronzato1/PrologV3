.Net MAUI will introduce a new Hybrid approach to building apps, similar to what you can do with Electron, but with .NET

With the BlazorWebView you can build apps where you can reuse the components you have built for your Blazor websites. You can also access the native APIs of the platform. This session will show you how you can use the new BlazorWebView to build an awesome app using this hybrid approach. We will use code and components from our website and use native features to build a great user experience. Finally, we will look at when to choose web components over native APIs and the other way around.
