Blazor is an open-source web framework for building single-page applications (SPAs) using C# and Dot Net.

Here are some of the key advantages of coding with Blazor:
- Full-stack development: Blazor allows developers to build both the front-end and back-end of an application using C#, eliminating the need to switch between different programming languages and reducing the complexity of full-stack development.
- Reuse of existing .NET libraries: Developers can use their existing .NET libraries and skills when building Blazor applications, making it easier to write and maintain code.
- Improved performance: Blazor uses WebAssembly, a low-level binary format, to execute C# code in the browser, leading to improved performance and responsiveness compared to traditional JavaScript-based SPAs.
- Integration with Azure: Blazor is tightly integrated with Azure, making it easy to deploy and manage applications on the Microsoft cloud platform.
- Productivity boost: Blazor allows developers to build complex web applications faster and more efficiently, thanks to its support for a rich set of .NET libraries and tools, as well as its ability to handle complex UI and data interactions.
- Increased developer satisfaction: Blazor offers a modern and enjoyable development experience, allowing developers to use the language and tools they already know and love to build modern web applications.


In conclusion, Blazor provides many advantages for developers looking to build web applications with .NET, including increased productivity, improved performance, and enhanced developer satisfaction.
