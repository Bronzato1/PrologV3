After completing the Azure DevOps path you’ll have the core hands-on knowledge and skills to deliver higher quality automated deployments to Azure more frequently and securely. Once you’ve got the Azure basics down, you’ll learn how to setup and use the Azure tools and services that underpin DevOps processes. This includes automation, containerisation and preparing for your Developer and Administrator Associate certifications. From there you’ll learn the specialised DevOps services and processes that work best with Azure and prepare for your DevOps Expert certification. To crown it off, you’ll develop the applied Azure architecture skills that a Guru DevOps practitioner needs. These flexible paths let you skip what you know and start at the appropriate lesson, whether you're a total beginner or looking to take your Azure DevOps skills to the next level. And like all ACG learning, these paths have a major focus on practical, step-by-step learning using hands-on labs. 

This path includes five certifications: 
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Azure Developer Associate
- Microsoft Certified: Azure DevOps Engineer Expert
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert
