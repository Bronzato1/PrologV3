To create every type of application based on .NET 6, developers will default to Visual Studio, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from Microsoft, targeted at .NET developers. Using Visual Studio, developers can create web, cloud, desktop and mobile applications, as well as AI solutions.

This path will teach you how to become proficient with the many aspects of the Visual Studio environment. All courses use Visual Studio 2022.

First, you will learn about the core features of Visual Studio 2022, including its powerful code-editor that makes developers productive thanks to features such as IntelliSense and IntelliCode. Next, you will learn more specific aspects such as working efficiently with Git and GitHub from Visual Studio. Through Visual Studio’s Test Explorer, managing and running unit tests is supported from the IDE as well. The IDE also comes with many tools to improve on code quality and that’s covered here too. Finally, you’ll learn more advanced topics such as how to create and manage NuGet packages as well as the different options to work with Azure from within Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2022 is the IDE of choice to build all types of .NET 6 applications. After watching the courses in this path, you can therefore apply what you have learned to build all types of .NET applications. You can head over to the ASP.NET Core path to learn how to build server-side applications or APIs. You can learn how to create mobile applications with .NET Maui or desktop applications with WPF. All of these (and more) application types are supported from Visual Studio 2022.
